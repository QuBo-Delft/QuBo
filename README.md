## Description of project
Due to the restriction of remote education, interactions between lecturers and students have become extremely difficult. To enable smoother interactions during the lecture and to facilitate the learning environment, the TU Delft OOPP Group 5 (2020-2021) has decided to build a Question Board application named QuBo. This is an application that aims to improve the quality of lectures on both the lecturer side and the student side. Students can join the question board created by a lecturer and post questions during the lecture, the lecturer and teaching assistants (moderators) can answer these questions and manage the question board easily. Moreover, QuBo supports polling such that lecturers can recieve students' response during the lecture.
