- Should we use a "development" branch or can we just merge into the master branch?

- Should students be allowed to ask questions before the question board opens?
    - Should students be allowed to access the board before the specified start time?
- Should we allow users to enter a username?
- Should we allow moderators to ban specific IP addresses?
    - What should banned IP addresses be allowed to access?
    - Should these IP addresses be banned only for that specific question board?
- Should there be an event log that contains all activities?
    - What activities should it contain? 
        - Pace votes? Questions? Edits? Delete?
- Should moderators be allowed to limit the amount of activities per user?
    - Should this be for specific activity types?
- Does the UI look as you imagined?
