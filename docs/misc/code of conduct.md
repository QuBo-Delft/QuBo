## Code of Conduct (*OOPP Group 5*)
  
1. Everyone is expected to make a full and fair contribution in terms of working hours to the work of the project. All assigned tasks should be completed to the best of their ability before the specified deadlines.
  
2. All group members are expected to stay up-to-date with messages sent through the Discord server and the WhatsApp group. They are expected to check Discord at least twice a day.
  
3. All group members will treat other members with courtesy and respect their opinions, even if they do not necessarily agree with them.
  
4. When a group member disagrees with another member’s opinion, they must give constructive criticism directly, but in a non-offensive way. All group members must accept constructive criticism and try to improve themselves.
  
5. All group members must attend all arranged meetings unless they have a good reason which prevents them from doing so. They must not be more than 5 minutes late to the meetings, and being late is only allowed occasionally.
  
6. A decision affecting the team or the project must be made in a democratic way. In the case of a tie, a special meeting must be called upon.
  
7. All group members are expected to seek out other team members for help when they are struggling or things are unclear to them. The other group members are then expected to clear the confusion. If the other group members cannot help, the TA shall be contacted for clarification.
  
8. BuddyCheck evaluations must be accomplished in a rational way with no bias toward any individual.
  
9. When two members disagree on an issue, they must first discuss this among themselves. If they are unable to resolve the conflict this way, they must share it with the rest of the group to help resolve the conflict.
  
10. The TA meeting agendas must be available through the docs/agendas folder in GitLab before the meeting starts. The content of this agenda should be discussed using the ‘agenda’ channel of the Discord server.
  
11. Tasks must be distributed fairly in a way that everyone spends an almost equal (±10%) amount of time on the project. The distribution of tasks will be discussed in the weekly meetings.
  
12. All group members are expected to stay up-to-date with the current state of the project on GitLab. They are therefore expected to at least check GitLab for Merge Requests once a day.
  
13. Harassment is harsh or unwelcome behaviour, either through actions or words, that create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for an individual or a group of people. This kind of behaviour will not be tolerated and shall immediately be reported to the TA.
  
14. Comments or behaviour, like described under section 13, that discriminate against certain group members on stereotypes or prejudices, is prohibited and shall immediately be reported to the TA. This includes, but is not limited to, racial slurs, mimicking or mocking, exclusion and homophobic behaviour.
  
15. English is to be spoken during all meetings. This prevents the exclusion of those not sharing the same first language or cultural background. It also ensures professionalism.
  
16. All group members should be reasonably reachable between 9 am till 5 pm CET (UTC/GMT+1).
  
16. All group members are expected to have at least one free evening from Monday till Friday. They are also expected to have one free time slot during the weekend for a meeting to be planned.
  
18. Everyone is required to act as note taker and chair at least once during TA meetings.
  
19. All group members are expected to follow the right issue and merge request templates when creating them. It is also expected that they follow the proper code and commenting style, discussed with the group.
  
20. In the case of a disaster (e.g. broken master branch), all directly affected should be notified immediately. In the case of assistance being required, everyone who is available or able to make time must help out.
  
21. Meetings are to be held online on Discord, as meeting physically is currently not possible because of the epidemic.
  
**If a team member breaks the Code of Conduct:**
- 1st offence: Warning during agenda meeting.
- 2nd offence: Offence will be reported to the TA.
- 3rd+ offence: Offence will immediately be reported to the TA and further actions will be taken based on his opinion.
