## Code of Conduct (*OOPP Group 5*)
  
1. Everyone is expected to make a full and fair contribution in terms of working hours to the work of the project. All assigned tasks should be completed to the best of their ability before the specified deadlines.
  
2. All group members are expected to stay up-to-date with messages sent through the Discord server and the WhatsApp group. They are expected to check Discord at least twice a day.
  
3. All group members will treat other members with courtesy and respect their opinions, even if they do not necessarily agree with them.
  
4. When a group member disagrees with another member’s opinion, they must give constructive criticism directly, but in a non-offensive way. All group members must accept constructive criticism and try to improve themselves.
  
5. All group members must attend all arranged meetings unless they have a good reason which prevents them from doing so. They must not be more than 5 minutes late to the meetings, and being late is only allowed occasionally.
  
6. A decision affecting the team or the project must be made in a democratic way. In the case of a tie, a special meeting must be called upon.
  
7. All group members are expected to seek out other team members for help when they are struggling or things are unclear to them. The other group members are then expected to clear the confusion. If the other group members cannot help, the TA shall be contacted for clarification.
  
8. BuddyCheck evaluations must be accomplished in a rational way with no bias toward any individual.
  
9. When two members disagree on an issue, they must first discuss this among themselves. If they are unable to resolve the conflict this way, they must share it with the rest of the group to help resolve the conflict.
  
10. The TA meeting agendas must be available through the docs/agendas folder in GitLab before the meeting starts. The content of this agenda should be discussed using the ‘agenda’ channel of the Discord server.
  
11. Tasks must be distributed fairly in a way that everyone spends an almost equal (±10%) amount of time on the project. The distribution of tasks will be discussed in the weekly meetings.
  
**If a team member breaks the Code of Conduct:**
- 1st offence: Warning during agenda meeting.
- 2nd offence: Offence will be reported to the TA.
